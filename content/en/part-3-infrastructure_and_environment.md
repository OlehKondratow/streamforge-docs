# Part III: Platform Development Roadmap (SRE & DevOps)

The current StreamForge architecture is a solid foundation for implementing advanced SRE (Site Reliability Engineering) and DevOps practices. This section describes the plan to transform the platform into a truly self-healing and antifragile system.

### **Chapter 11: Self-Healing Engine: Automatic Recovery**

#### **11.1. Designing a Kubernetes Operator Based on Events from `queue-events`**

**Objective:** To create an operator that will proactively manage the lifecycle of workers, reacting to business events, and not just technical failures.

**Operator Logic:**
1.  **Subscription to `queue-events`:** The operator will listen to the telemetry topic.
2.  **State Analysis:** If no `loading` events are received from a worker (Kubernetes Job) for a long time, or an `error` event is received, the operator classifies this Job as "stuck" or "failed".
3.  **Corrective Action:** The operator will automatically delete the problematic Job and create a new one to restart the task. This allows for self-healing at the business logic level, not just at the pod crash level.

### **Chapter 12: Chaos Engineering: Stress Testing**

#### **12.1. Implementing the `LitmusChaos` Framework and Designing Chaos Experiments**

**Objective:** To regularly and automatically test the system's resilience to various types of failures.

**Examples of Chaos Experiments:**
*   **`pod-delete`:** Random deletion of `loader-*` or `arango-connector` pods to verify that the Self-Healing operator correctly restarts them.
*   **`network-latency`:** Introducing delays in network interaction between microservices and Kafka to check how the system copes with network degradation.
*   **`kafka-broker-failure`:** Simulating the failure of one of the Kafka brokers to test the fault tolerance provided by Strimzi.

### **Chapter 13: Progressive Delivery: Safe Updates**

#### **13.1. Implementing Canary Deployments for `queue-manager` with `Argo Rollouts`**

**Objective:** To minimize risks when updating the critical `queue-manager` component.

**Canary Release Process:**
1.  `Argo Rollouts` deploys a new version of `queue-manager` alongside the old one and directs a small portion of traffic to it (e.g., 10%).
2.  For a certain period of time, `Argo Rollouts` automatically analyzes key Prometheus metrics for the new version (e.g., `http_request_duration_seconds`, `queue_requests_total{status="error"}`).
3.  **Automatic Promotion/Rollback:** If the metrics are within the normal range, `Argo Rollouts` gradually increases the traffic to the new version to 100%. If the metrics degrade, an automatic rollback to the previous stable version occurs.
